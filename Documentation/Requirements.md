# Requirements

## Needed

  - [ ] (R1) When started, the program starts to countdown 25 minutes.
  - [ ] (R2) Progress is displayed.
  - [ ] (R3) There is an option to pause the countdown and continue it later without closing the application.

## Maybe later

  - [ ] Automatically enhancing pomodoro.log
  - [ ] Another sound every n seconds when no pomodoro is running, so I can't forget to restart the timer.
  - [ ] Another running mode, where the time is counting up. The number of pomodoros is calculated as time / 25minutes.
