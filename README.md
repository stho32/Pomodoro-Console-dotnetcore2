# Pomodoro Console Application

This project is developed with dotnetcore2. 
Thus you may use it with Windows, Linux and Mac.

It's a small pomodoro application for the command line.
In its basic operational mode you start it, then it counts down a pomodoro and
finally it plays a sound. While counting down you have the possibility to pause it.

See [requirements](Documentation/Requirements.md) for the requirements.

You might also be interested in my [notes](Documentation/Notes.md) where I share my thoughts about why I chose one way of solution over another. 

And here you can find my [pomodoro-log](Documentation/Pomodoro-Log.md) for the project.
